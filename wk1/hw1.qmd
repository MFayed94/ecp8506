# Objectives:

-   Create a new github repository under your github account using [ecp8506-template](https://github.com/UMN-ECP-PMX/ecp8506-template) as a template repository.
-   Perform `git clone` to clone the repository to your local MSI disk.
-   Create a new file in your local repository, then perform `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to add the new file to your remote github repository.

## Create a new github repository

-   Navigate your browser to [ecp8506-template](https://github.com/UMN-ECP-PMX/ecp8506-template) github repository. Click **Use this template** on the top right corner.

## Clone the repository to local

-   Start a new Rstudio Server session on MSI.
-   Use RStudio IDE functionality to start a project using Version Control or in terminal, perform `git clone` to clone the repository to local MSI disk.
-   Open the R project file (`.rproj`) file in the local repository.
-   Run `renv::restore()` to restore the installation of all the R packages. This step might take quite a few minutes to complete.

## Create a new file in the local reposiotry and add it to the remote repository

-   Create a new R script in the local repository, names it as you like, for example `xxx.R`
-   Use RStudio IDE functionality to add, commit and push the new file to the remote repository.
-   If you are using terminal:
    -   In terminal, run `git add xxx.R`.
    -   In terminal, run `git commit -m "add a test R script"`. Here, `-m` means leave a message with the text inside the "" as the message contents.
    -   In terminal, run `git push`. If you see the output looks like this, your have successfully added the new file in your remote github repository.
