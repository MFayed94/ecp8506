## Lots of Experiments...

First time

-   Rebuild this course around open-source R package `mrgsolve`.
-   Work with HPC (MSI) for a graduate-level course.
-   Large-scale academia/industry collaborations in teaching.

## Objectives

* Primary
  -   Understand the concepts of model-informed decision making using pharmacometric simulations.
  -   Learn relevant tools (i.e., **`mrgsolve`**) to perform pharmacometric simulations.
  -   Know different simulation methods, and identify a method given scenarios.  
  
* Secondary  
  -   Learn other tools (e.g., MSI/HPC, Github, `renv`) to ensure the efficiency, collaborative capability and reproducibility of pharmacometric works.

## What to Expect...

-   **NOT** to teach pharmacometric model building/development.
-   Focusing on what you can do (i.e., simulate) when you have a pharmacometric model already.

## MSI

[Minnesota Supercomputing institute](https://msi.umn.edu/)

-   A core research facility at UMN
-   Provides high-performance cluster (HPC) for computational works
    -   Efficient
    -   Collaborative
    -   Reproducible
-   [MSI X101 - Introduction to the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI)](https://learning.umn.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=43305250&courseTitle=introduction-to-the-minnesota-supercomputing-institute-msi)

## MSI Access

-   Access to MSI resources is available to Principal Investigators (PIs). Individual can access MSI by
    -   Participating a PI's research group
    -   Participating a MSI class account (`ecp8506`, deadline **12/22/2024**)

## VPN

MSI is accessible if you are

-   You are connected to "eduroam" network on campus.
-   You are off campus but connecting to the University’s Virtual Private Network (VPN).
    -   do NOT select the channel named **“UMN - Departmental Pools”**.

## Interactive HPC

-   Several ways are available to interact with MSI
-   In this course, we will use [Open Ondemand](https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/) RStudio Server

## Check primary MSI group

![](pics/Primary%20group.png)

If output shows

-   `ecp8506`, your primary group is `ecp8506`, storage available until 12/22/2024.
-   Something else, you are involved in multiple groups. It's up to you to
    -   Keep using the other group storage throughout the course
    -   Following additional procedure to switch the primary group to `ecp8506`

## The end

Next - `Github` and `renv`

## Switch primary MSI group 1 (optional)
