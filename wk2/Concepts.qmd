## Developing a New Drug is Increasingly Expensive and Time-Consuming

-   The median capitalized R&D investment to bring a new drug to the market was **\$985.3 million**. [^1]
-   The median clinical development time for FDA-approved drugs from 2010-2020 was reported to be **8.3 years**. [^2]

## Deloitte: Measuring the Return from Pharmaceutical Innovation

<!-- *"Our analysis over the past 14 years has shown a steady decline in productivity between 2010 and 2019, a short-lived improvement due to the impact of the COVID-19 assets in 2020 and 2021, followed by a dip in 2022. In the 2023 cycle, we are beginning to see signs of some improvement..."*^[Deloitte: Measuring the return from pharmaceutical innovation – 14th edition] -->

## Models?

::: incremental
-   Knowledge management tools[^5]
    -   Knowledge of biological systems
        -   Drug properties (e.g., potency, binding affinity, etc)
        -   Disease mechanism (e.g., signaling pathways)
        -   How a drug affects the human body (e.g., PK)
        -   How a human body responds to the drug (e.g., PD)

## Models

<!-- :::{.incremental} -->

<!-- -   Mathematical representations of accumulated knowledge in physiology and pharmacology -->

<!-- -   Can be used to answer drug development/clinical questions -->

<!-- -   The structural and statistical components of the model determine the type of questions to answer -->

## Simulations {.smaller}

-   Allow us to **extract information** from models

![](pics/exsim.png){width="80%"}

::: incremental
-   Allow us to answer drug development/clinical questions in a quantitative manner
    -   Are does adjustments needed in patients with a specific genotype?
    -   Which dosing regimen provides a better efficacy/safety profiles?
    -   What clinical effect might be observed if a metabolic inhibitor co-administered?
-   Enables the decision-making in drug development / precision dosing

## The Application of Simulations[^6] {.smaller}

-   Analysis
    -   Model evaluations (e.g., predictive checks)
-   Illustration
    -   Summarise and illustrate data/concepts
    -   Integrate information across multiple sources
-   Exploration
    -   Interpolate between observed data
    -   Extrapolate to new conditions
    -   Express expected range of variability and/or uncertainty in response relationship
-   Decision-making
    -   Quantify the probability of outcome given decision path

## General Framework[^6]

[^6]: Marc G, ACoP, 2019

::: incremental
-   Define the Questions
-   Translate into Quantitative Terms
-   Define Prior Knowledge, Assumptions, Constrains
-   Model Development and Evaluations
-   Plan and Execute Simulations
-   Summarise and Present Results

## Defining the Questions[^6] {.smaller}

-   Guide model development and evaluation.
    -   Which structural models?
    -   Which statistical models?

. . .

-   Guide simulation design.
    -   Alternative dosing regimens?
    -   Number of subjects, patient characteristics, duration of simulation.
    -   Variability versus uncertainty?

## Translate into Quantitative Terms[^6] {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   The question must be translated into quantitative terms before simulations.

    -   Question: How many subjects are needed in the upcoming pediatric PK study?
    -   Quantitative translation: How many subjects needed to be enrolled to prospectively powered to target a **95% CI** within **60% to 140% of the geometric mean estimate of CL** for Drug A in each pediatric group with **\>80% power**.

-   Defining the quantitative criteria is the **key** to formulate modeling and simulation strategies.

## Assumptions and Constrains[^6] {.smaller}

    -   Same exposure-response in adults and pediatrics?
    -   Fixing parameter values because we have no data to estimate them?
    -   Assuming a covariance matrix of random effects?
    -   What is the clinically meaningful change in effect size? Subjective specification?

. . .

    -   Limited sample size for trial design
    -   Limited number of samples per subjects
    -   Limited follow-up time

-   Statistical components
    -   Deterministic versus stochastic simulations
    -   Include inter-occasion variability?
    -   With/without parameter uncertainty

## Summarise and Present Results[^6]

-   Re-state and answer the questions asked at the beginning.
-   Be prepare to present to the audience with a diverse background.
    -   Emphasize on important findings.
    -   Focus on 1-2 key figures / tables that likely impacts the decision-making.
    -   Usually not so useful to present P-values and model diagnostics.
