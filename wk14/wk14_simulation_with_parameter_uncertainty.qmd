# Outline

-   Forest plot introduction
-   Hands-on

## Forest plot introduction {.smaller}

-   Traditionally, forest plot used to display results of multiple clinical studies[^1].
    -   Extensively used in Cross-study meta-analyses.
    -   Point estimates with associated intervals are displayed.
-   Recently, its applications in pharmacometrics were documented in the FDA popPK guidance[^2].
    -   Simulation with uncertainty on fixed effect parameters.
    -   Visualize the covariate effect on simulated parameters of interest (e.g., AUC, Cmax, T\>MIC, etc).

## Simulation workflow {.smaller}

-   Acquire parameter uncertainty distributions (covariance matrix, bootstrap, SIR or Bayesian posterior).

. . .

-   Simulate with parameter uncertainty on fixed-effect parameters for:
    -   a reference subject.
    -   a few non-reference subjects by **changing one covariate at a time** (*ceteris paribus*).

. . .

-   For each subject at each simulation replicate, PK/PD parameters of interest (e.g., AUC, Cmax, etc) were calculated.

. . .

-   Standardize the PK/PD parameters of each non-reference subject relative to the reference subject.

. . .

-   Plotting the simulation.

## Advantages and disadvantages[^6] [^7] {.smaller}

[^6]: Marier et al. 2022. CPT:PSP

[^7]: Jonsson and Nyberg. 2024. CPT:PSP

-   Advantages:
    -   Visually appealing and intuitively understandable.
    -   Allow the assessment of covariate effect one at a time.
    -   Provide uncertainty measurements around the point estimates.
        -   Potential to make inferences on statistical significance and clinical relevance.

. . .

-   Disadvantages:
    -   Do not account for correlation among covariates.
    -   Non-plausible scenrios can be obtained by varying covariates at a time.
    -   Only assessing "marginal effects".

## Forest plot with both uncertainty and variability[^8] {.smaller}

## Simulation workflow {.smaller}

-   Simulate a large and realistic covariate distribution (virtual population).

. . .

-   Pharmacometric simulations using the covariate distribution, between-subject variability and uncertainty.

. . .

-   For each subject at each simulation replicate, PK/PD parameters of interest (e.g., AUC, Cmax, etc) were calculated.

. . .

-   Stratify covariates based on quantiles, and standardize the PK/PD parameters of each subject in non-reference quantile relative to the subject in reference quantile.

. . .

-   Plotting the simulation.

## Controversy {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   The application of a forest plot constructed with both uncertainty and variability is not well-documented in the recent FDA popPK guidance.[^10]

-   "Simulations based on uncertainty of fixed-effect parameters, BSV, and uncertainty on BSV is considered more robust and realistic, as it provides the joint effects of BSV and multiple covariates based on a database of real patients or in a virtual population with correlated covariates."[^11]

-   "Although it is technically feasible to use forest plots for visualizing between-subject variability, we strongly advise against it...blurring the use of the error bars leads to a significant risk of confusion for the viewer"[^12]
